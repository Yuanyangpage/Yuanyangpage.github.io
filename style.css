/*
 * This style.css file is intentionally minimal as most styling is handled by Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in the HTML.
 * Use this file for any custom overrides or styles that are difficult to achieve with Tailwind alone.
 */

/* No specific CSS rules are added here as all styling is done inline with Tailwind. */
/* However, if you need to add custom fonts not handled by default Tailwind setup, or very specific global overrides,
   you would add them here. For example: */
/*
body {
    font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;
}
